we will dive deeper into HTML by focusing on two important components: Tables and Forms. Tables are used to present data in a structured format, while forms are essential for user input and data submission. Throughout this project, you will learn to use the following HTML elements:

- Table Tag: `<table>`
- Table Row Tag: `<tr>`
- Table Header Cell Tag: `<th>`
- Table Data Cell Tag: `<td>`
- Form Tag: `<form>`
- Input Tags: `<input>` (various types), `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<option>`, `<label>`, `<button>`

By the end of this project, you will be proficient in creating tables and forms, and you'll understand how to collect user input and process it.

## How to Use this Repository

This repository is organized into two main directories: `Event_Page_Project` and `Tables_Forms_Project`. Each directory contains a `starter` folder, which includes the initial code for the respective projects, and a `final` folder with the completed code.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/html-project-tutorial.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder of your choice, either `Event_Page_Project` or `Tables_Forms_Project`.

3. Inside each project folder, you will find a `starter` folder. Open the `starter` folder in your preferred code editor to access the initial code.

4. Follow along with the YouTube tutorial series to build the projects step-by-step.

5. If you encounter any issues or have questions during the tutorial, feel free to open an issue in this repository. We encourage collaboration and learning together!
